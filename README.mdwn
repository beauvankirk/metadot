Metadot: a dotfile management system
====================================

Inspired by https://github.com/holman/dotfiles

Instalation
-----------

    git clone --recursive git://URL/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

Some configuration files depends on the "scripts" repository to
be cloned at ~/apps/scripts.

Backups of your old files can be put into .dotfiles/backups.

Layout
------

- ~/.dotfiles: where all dotfiles modules are stored
- ~/.backups: backups of old config files
- ~/.custom: your custom configuration where you can override parameters

Module format
-------------

Modules rest at ~/.dotfiles/modules and can be git submodules. File format is:

    [path/]<name>[.dot][.link]

Which means files

- with a .link extension are linked at $HOME.
- with a .dot.link extension are converted to a dotfile: vimrc.dot.link is linked as ~/.vimrc.
- with other extensions are ignored.

Also,

- file structure is preserved: file apps/scripts.link is linked as $HOME/apps/scripts.
- nested structures are allowed: config.dot/awesome.link is linked as $HOME/.config/awesome

Todo
----

- Put modules as git submodules.
- Better integration with scripts project.
