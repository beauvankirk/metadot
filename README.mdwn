Metadot: a dotfile management system
====================================

Inspired by https://github.com/holman/dotfiles

Instalation
-----------

Get the code:

    git clone --recursive git://URL/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

Then add .dotfiles folder to your path.

Usage
-----

List existing modules:

    metadot ls

Load a module:

    metadot load <module>

Load all modules:

    metadot load --all

Layout
------

- ~/.dotfiles: where all dotfiles modules are stored
- ~/.backups: backups of old config files
- ~/.custom: your custom configuration where you can override parameters

Module format
-------------

Modules rest at ~/.dotfiles/modules and can be git submodules. File format is:

    [path/]<name>[.dot][.link]

Which means files

- with a .link extension are linked at $HOME.
- with a .dot.link extension are converted to a dotfile: vimrc.dot.link is linked as ~/.vimrc.
- with other extensions are ignored.

Also,

- file structure is preserved: file apps/scripts.link is linked as $HOME/apps/scripts.
- nested structures are allowed: config.dot/awesome.link is linked as $HOME/.config/awesome

Todo
----

- Make modules as git submodules.
- Better integration with scripts project.
- Module descriptions.
- Basic dependency.
